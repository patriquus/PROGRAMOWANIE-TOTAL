Oasis SE.
Version 1.0 Final Beta
Copyright 1998

Oasis SE is a Freeware Help Authoring Tool for 
Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0. In addition to
the standard list of files, you will also 
require the microsoft help compiler (hcrtf.exe)
version 4.x at least. This file is distributed 
by Microsoft as part of the Help Workshop application 
(hcwsetup.exe). Most third-party development tools 
also ship it. Check in the \bin directory of 
your tool to see if you already have it. If not, 
a copy of hcwsetup.exe can be found on my website: 
http://www.adept.co.za/~oasisdev

The standard distribution includes the following files:
LANGUAGE.DAT
OS.DAT
_ISDEL.EXE
SETUP.EXE
_INST32I.EX_
_SETUP.DLL
SETUP.INS
_SYS1.CAB
SETUP.BMP
DATA.TAG
